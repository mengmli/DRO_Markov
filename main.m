% for executing all the subfunctions and producing final plots

% main workflow for the code:

%{
    I. Sampling & Preprocessing
        1. read the generated samples from predefined markov chain dynamics
        2. estimate the transition kernels from the generated samples
    II. FW step
        return the predictors given a prescriptor value
    III. Plot
